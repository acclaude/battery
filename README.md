# Battery charge limiter for M1 Mac devices

This tool makes it possible to keep a chronically plugged in M1 Macbook at `80%` battery, since that will prolong the longevity of the battery. It is free and open-source and will remain that way.

> Want to know if this tool does anything or is just a placebo? Read [this excellent article](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries). TL;DR: keep your battery cool, keep it at 80% when plugged in, and discharge it as shallowly as feasible.

### Requirements

This is an app for M1 Macs. It will not work on non-M1 macs. Do you have an older Mac? Consider the free version of the [Al Dente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) software package. It is a good alternative and has a premium version with many more features.

### Installation

- Option 3: command-line only installation 

The first time you open the app, it will ask for your administator password so it can install the needed components. Please note that the app:
